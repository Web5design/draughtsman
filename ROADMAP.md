More of a wishlist / one day maybe than a roadmap really...

* Better error handling
* Configuration by convention -or- through a .draughtsman file (and optional .nomagic file)
* A Homebrew formula and a deb/ubuntu package
* Selective reloading (e.g. only reload the CSS, not the entire page if it isn't necessary)
* A cli flag to disable live reloading, as well as a URL argument ?nolive
* Support for layout templates and partials (underscore convention?)
* A way to make multiple dynamic pages out of a single template and JSON file
  (ideal for showing a couple of different examples of the same page)
* dummy data generator & dummy image generator
* add your own static resources and handlers through the command line, using an interface
  somewhat like: draughtsman addhandler ./path/to/handler.js
* static site generation, including minification and concatenation of scripts and css
* PHP support
