Draughtsman is an MIT-licensed tool for front-end developers who want a cutting-edge
stack while prototyping (like Jade, Stylus and CoffeeScript for you node.js aficionados), 
but can't be bothered to run all sorts of command-line tools and who don't want to 
set up an entire project structure simply to test out a few layouts in their favorite
CSS alternative.

In addition to parsing .styl, .coffee and .jade files, Draughtsman will also search for
an eponymous .yml, .txt or .json file and use whatever it finds there to feed dummy data 
to your template.

This application is solely intended to facilitate front-end prototyping. Once you or your
team moves on from sketching, forget about Draughtsman and use a proper dev environment.

# Installation

Draughtsman can work as a web server or as a reverse proxy. To use Draughtsman as a rudimentary
web server (bypassing e.g. Apache entirely), simply start up the app by opening up a terminal and 
execute `draughtsman /my/basepath`. Surf to http://0.0.0.0:3400/ for a directory listing and take
it from there.

To use Draughtsman as a reverse proxy, you'll need to configure your main web server. For Apache, 
a configuration like this should work:

    <VirtualHost *:*>
        <Location />
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
            ProxyPassMatch ^(/.*\.)(jade|styl|coffee)$ http://localhost:3400$1
            ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8888
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

It should be part of your `httpd.conf`.

For NGINX, try something like this: 

    server {
        listen 80;
        ...
    
        location ~ \.(jade|styl|coffee)$ {
            proxy_pass        http://127.0.0.1:3400;
            proxy_redirect    default;
        }
    }

For additional convenience, you may want to deamonize the application and run it after 
login or startup just like your web server. Use whatever method or tool you prefer; 
upstart is a good bet if you're on Ubuntu.
